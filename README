A simple Python script to clean up the /var/cache/pacman/pkg directory.
More versatile than 'pacman -Sc' in that you can select how many old versions
to keep.

Usage: cacheclean [-p] [-v] [-d] n

Options:
    n    How many generations of each package to keep (required).
   -p    Preview what would be deleted; forces verbose (-v) mode.
   -v    Show deleted packages.
   -d    Specify a non-standard cache directory.
